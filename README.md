# InstaLikes
  InstaLikes is a Instagram like bot/browser extension. It is for purely educational purposes. I do not condone it's use.

  Note: Only test in Firefox.

## Usage
  Go to [about:debugging](about:debugging), check `Enable add-on debugging`, and `Load Temporary Add-on`. Now, upon going to [Instagram](instagram.com), the extension will start automatically liking the first post it can, then reloading. The frequency is set to an average of 90 like an hour, but the time between likes is randomly decided.

  To disable the extension, go to [about:addons](about:addons) and `Disable` InstaLikes.
